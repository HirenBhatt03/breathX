- **Air (Vayu)**: Airflow Comes from the sides of the nostrils and moves obliquely, Light, fluctuating, and mildly cool
- **Ether (Akasha)**: Feels like there‚Äôs no clear airflow; only warm vapor felt on the hand. No distinct direction, indicating a space-like quality 

### 2. **Observe the Taste in the Mouth**

- **Earth (Prithvi)**: Sweet taste
- **Water (Jala)**: Slightly astringent taste
- **Fire (Agni)**: Spicy or pungent taste
